## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Express

We used Express to build the API. Postman was used to test the API. Heroku was used for hosting the API and Cors was also installed to test locally from client side.  


## Lessons Learned:

Addin two lines of code for Cors helps anyone using the API to test locally.
